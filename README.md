# **Logic Pro Project – Version Control with Git** 🎶  

## **Project Overview**  
This repository contains a **Logic Pro X project**, version-controlled using Git. The goal is to track changes, manage different versions, and ensure a smooth workflow for music production.  

---

## **Project Structure**  
```
/ProjectName.logicx     # Logic Pro project file  
/Audio Files/           # Recorded/imported audio files (if included)  
/MIDI/                  # MIDI regions and instrument tracks  
/Bounces/               # Final exported tracks (excluded from Git)  
/.gitignore             # Prevents large/unnecessary files from being tracked  
```

## **Using Git LFS for Large Audio Files (Optional)**  
If working with large **WAV, AIFF, or MP3 files**, enable **Git LFS**:  
```sh
git lfs install
git lfs track "*.wav" "*.aif" "*.mp3"
git add .gitattributes
git commit -m "Added Git LFS tracking"
git push origin main
```

## **Best Practices for Version Control**  
✔️ **Commit regularly** – Save progress at key stages.  
✔️ **Use branches** – Experiment without affecting the main version.  
✔️ **Exclude unnecessary files** – Use `.gitignore` for large renders.  
✔️ **Backup important versions** – Save milestone commits before major changes.
